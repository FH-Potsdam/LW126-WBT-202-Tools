LW126-WBT-202-Tools
===================

Some tools/scripts to work with the [WBT 202 GPS](http://www.wintec-gps.de/wintec_wbt-202.php) Tracker on Mac OSX

this is mostly a fork of https://gist.github.com/y-namiki/3248436  

Only thing I did is adding a folder creation on the desktop.  

##Prerequisites  

[gpsbabel](http://www.gpsbabel.org) command line tool. Install via [homebrew](http://brew.sh)  

    brew install gpsbabel
